## Cheat Descriptions

### Infinite Health
- This cheat freezes your health to a high value (e.g., 500), making it impossible to die in the game.

### Infinite Mana
- Similar to Infinite Health, this will ensure you never run out of mana during gameplay.

### One-Hit Kill
- This cheat sets the enemy health to zero, allowing you to kill enemies with a single hit.

### Item Spawner
- Use the dropdown menu to select an item from the list, and click **Spawn Item** to instantly add it to your inventory.

### Speed Hack
- Modify the game’s speed multiplier (e.g., 2x speed) for faster movement, faster time progression, or quicker actions.

### Buff Freezer
- This will prevent any negative buffs, such as Poison, Slowness, or On Fire, from affecting your character.

### Time Control
- Pause or fast-forward the in-game time to adjust day and night cycles or pause gameplay altogether.

### Freeze Inventory Slot
- Freeze a specific inventory slot to prevent changes to the items in that slot.

### Extended Reach
- Allows you to interact with NPCs, chests, or objects from a farther distance than normal.

## Troubleshooting

- **Cheat Engine Not Attaching**: Make sure **Terraria** is running before attaching **Cheat Engine** to it. If you're using a non-standard Terraria version, ensure that you're using the correct **bit version** (32-bit or 64-bit).
- **Item Spawner Not Working**: Ensure that you're selecting a valid item from the dropdown list. If items are not appearing correctly, check your game version and update the cheat table.
